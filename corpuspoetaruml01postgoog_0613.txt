attempt has been made 1n this country to bring together within the

compass os one book the works os the various Latin Poets; and tlte ⁴
· undoubted demand which exists amongst scholars sor a book os the kind
has met with no other satisfaction than could be afforded by Walker’s
volume and that os W. E. Weber published at F rankiort in 1833.

The work cannot, therefore, be regarded either as superfluous or
premature, more especially as it has been projected ona more satisfactory
plan than either oi its predecessore The'aim os the Editor has been to ⁶
obtain a thoroughly good text, together with such critical notes as seemed
to be strictly necessary, from the most competent available authority on
each author, so that the book might represent in as trustworthy a sorm as ’
possible the textual scholarship os the present day.

The“ Corpus” will be completed 1n four parts, making two volumes
