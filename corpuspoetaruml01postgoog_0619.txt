Prof. R. l'. Tvaanut, LLD, Trinity Collcge, Dama-“1 look on itas a most valuable work,
and highly creditable to British scholarship. Not only for the judgment and learning displayed by the
editors of the poets, but also as astandard of c'orrect Latin orthography, the book is indispensable for
every earnest student of the classica, whether teacher or learner.''

Jotrw Perua, Litt.D., Mosterof chntt’s‘cdlege, Cambridge-‘⁶ English scholars owe a great debt
to Professor Postgate for the admirable editing of the authors-contained in the two first parts, and 1
have no doubt that the third partvvill be equally good. ·Such a book has long· been wanted, and 1 for
one am very grateful for it” '

Prof. Α. Gunuusw, Untbersity ‹vsPennwlvama—“The distinguished scholars who have edited
the texts have conferred a distinct boon upon all workers in latin literature by placing within imme·
diate reacb, and in a form admirably adapted for scientific work, all the great poets of Rome. The
{tlltlhllttll ll⁰2ttlthbt⁰tt¹tltb iiiiii. {llssltltss fitttkllttttttltt
of the poema, in the ‘Corpus’ were not easily accessible, or, aswas notalily the case with Manilius,
available only in antiquated recensions-which in no way satisfied the scientific standards of modern
scholarship, and were, therefore,·practically useless for any serious purpose. 1 have no hesitation in
saying that the ‘Corpus' ought to be found in every classical scholar’s library, the reasonable price
making its acquisitiongenerally possible, and 1 feel very sure that your laudable enterprise, entailing
as it dida very considerable outlay, will be rewarded beyond your most sanguine expectatione. Tbere
has never been anything like it in the market, for the collections of Weber and Walker, of blessed
memory, exhibited no scientifically constituted text or critical apparatus, which latter is, in fact, one
of the most invaluable features in the present work. maworn, the ‘Corpus' is an honour to English
scholarship, and its typographical neatness calls for thanks to the publishers.”
